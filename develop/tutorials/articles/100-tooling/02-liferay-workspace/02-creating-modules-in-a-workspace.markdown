# Creating Modules in a Workspace

Modules are OSGi-based projects used to develop Liferay applications. In Liferay
Workspaces, Gradle is the build tool used to create Liferay modules. Before you
can begin creating your Liferay module projects from a Liferay Workspace, you'll
need to create a Liferay Workspace, which is covered in the
[Creating a Liferay Workspace](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-a-liferay-workspace)
tutorial. Once you've created your Liferay Workspace, you can begin using it to
create Gradle-based OSGi modules for @product@.

You can create modules in a Workspace via Blade CLI or by using Liferay IDE.
Because Liferay IDE uses the Blade CLI infrastructure under the hood, both
options offer the same flexibility and options. You can learn more about Blade
CLI in the [Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/blade-cli)
section of tutorials. In this tutorial, you'll learn about using a Liferay
Workspace to create modules via Blade CLI and Liferay IDE.

## Using Blade CLI

Creating Liferay modules in a workspace using Blade CLI is very similar to
creating them in a standalone environment. You can find the details of how to
create a module project using Blade CLI in the
[Creating Modules with Blade CLI](/develop/tutorials/-/knowledge_base/7-0/creating-modules-with-blade-cli)
tutorial.

In summary, you can view the available module templates by running `blade create
-l`. Each available template can be examined in more detail from the link
mentioned above. When creating modules in a workspace, you should navigate to
the `/modules` directory to create your project. You can also provide further
directory nesting into the `/modules` directory, if preferred. Your workspace,
by default, sets the directory where your modules should be stored by setting
the following property in the workspace's `gradle.properties` file:

    liferay.workspace.modules.dir=modules

Change this property if you'd like to store your modules in a different
directory.

When using Blade CLI, you'll have to manually edit your project's component
class. Blade CLI gives you the ability to specify the class's name, but all
other contents of the class can only be edited after the class is created. See
the next section on *Using Liferay IDE* for further details and important
dependency information on component classes.

It's as simple as that! You now know how to create modules in a Liferay
Workspace using Blade CLI's module templates. The great thing about Blade CLI is
that it can be used by any IDE that provides Gradle support (e.g., Eclipse,
IntelliJ, and Netbeans), which offers great flexibility. Because of this,
Liferay IDE takes advantage of Blade CLI by providing a GUI for you to work
with. You'll learn how to use Liferay IDE to create modules next.

## Using Liferay IDE

IDE provides a *Module Project Wizard* for users to create a variety of
different module projects. You can create a new Liferay module project by
navigating to *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay Module Project*.

![Figure 1: When selecting *New* &rarr; *Liferay Module Project*, a Module Project Wizard appears.](../../../images/new-module-project.png)

You're presented options for project name, location, build
type, and template type. Currently, you're only able to create a Gradle-based
module. The project templates will look familiar to you if you've already read
through the Blade CLI tutorials. The same templates are provided through this
wizard as what was available through Blade CLI. Click *Next* and you're given
additional configuration options for a component class.

![Figure 2: Specify your component class's details in the Portlet Component Class Wizard.](../../../images/component-class-wizard.png)

You can specify your component class's name, package name, and its properties.
The properties you assign are the ones found in the `@Component` annotation's
`property = {...}` assignment.

Once you've configured your module project's component class, click *Finish* to
create your project.

You can also create a new component class for a pre-existing module project.
Navigate to *File* &rarr; *New* &rarr; *Liferay Component Class*. This is a
similar wizard to the previous component class wizard, except you can select a
component class template. There are many templates in the `Component Class
Template` list:

- *Auth Failure*: processes a verify login failure
- *Auth Max Failure*: processes maximum number of login failures
- *Authenticator*: authenticates processing
- *Friendly URL Mapper*: processes Friendly URLs
- *GOGO Command*: creates a custom Gogo command
- *Indexer Post Processor*: creates a new Indexer Post Processor
- *Login Pre Action*: creates a login pre action
- *Model Listener*: sets a model listener
- *Poller Processor*: creates a new poller processor
- *Portlet*: creates a new portlet class file
- *Portlet Action Command*: creates a new portlet action command
- *Portlet Filter*: creates a new portlet filter
- *Rest*: calls and wraps inner service in the way of Rest
- *Service Wrapper*: creates a new service wrapper
- *Struts in Action*: creates a new strutus action
- *Struts Portlet Action*: creates a new struts portlet action

**Note:** When selecting the `Authenticator`, `Portlet Action Command`, `Rest`,
or `Service Wrapper` templates, you may run into some dependency issues that
could cause errors in your project. There is a set of steps outlined below that
you should follow, with sub-steps for each of the four templates that could
cause problems.

1. Open the module project's `build.gradle` file.
2. Check whether the appropriate dependencies exist. These are outlined below.
3. Right-click your project and select *Gradle* &rarr; *Refresh Gradle Project*.
4. If you're using the *Portlet Action Command* template, you'll also need to
change the component class declaration from implementing the `FreeMarkerPortlet`
class to extending it. For instance, your `*Portlet` component class should have
the following declared:

    YourPortletClass extends FreeMarkerPortlet

The dependencies to check for when using each template are outlined below:

**Authenticator**

- `compile com.liferay.portal:com.liferay.portal.kernel:VERSION`
- `compile org.osgi:org.osgi.service.component.annotations:VERSION`

**Portlet Action Command**

- `compile javax.portlet:portlet-api:VERSION`
- `compile javax.servlet:javax.servlet-api:VERSION`
- `compile org.osgi:org.osgi.service.component.annotations:VERSION`
- `compile com.liferay.portal:com.liferay.portal.kernel:VERSION`
- `compile com.liferay.portal:com.liferay.util.bridges:VERSION`
- `compile com.liferay.portal:com.liferay.util.taglib:VERSION`

**Rest**

- `compile javax.ws.rs:javax.ws.rs-api:VERSION`

**Service Wrapper**

- The service wrapper class being used. For example, if you're using the
  `BookmarksEntryLocalServiceWrapper`, the following dependency would be
  required:

        compile com.liferay:com.liferay.bookmarks.api:VERSION

Make sure the replace the `VERSION` text with the appropriate version for each
specified dependency.

Once you've created your module project, you can configure your project's
presentation in the IDE's Project Explorer. To change the project's
presentation, 

IDE also provides a method to import existing module projects. You can import a
module project by navigating to *File* &rarr; *Import* &rarr; *Liferay* &rarr;
*Liferay Module Project(s)*. Then point to the project location and click
*Finish*.

![Figure 3: Select the *Liferay Module Project(s)* to import a module project.](../../../images/import-wizard.png)

You now have the knowledge to create a Liferay module project from a Liferay
Workspace. Now go out there and get stuff done!
